acbcjsdodb : Bus :
1. Bus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a
single cable known as a central cable or bus.
2. It acts as a shared communication medium, i.e., if any device wants to send the
data to other devices, then it will send the data over the bus which in turn sends
the data to all the attached devices.
3. Bus topology is useful for a small number of devices.
4. As if the bus is damaged then the whole network fails.
